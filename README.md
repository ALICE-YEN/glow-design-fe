# Â±ÖÁÑ∂Â•ΩË®≠Ë®à Glow Design (Frontend)

## Overview
This project is an **interactive interior design tool** that allows users to design interior spaces with intuitive drag-and-drop functionality. The frontend is built with **TypeScript, Next.js, Redux, and Fabric.js**, providing a smooth and dynamic design experience.

The project is currently under development, with **70% of frontend functionalities completed**. Authentication is enabled, but it can be temporarily disabled for local testing.

## Features
### üé® **Design Features**
- **Wall Drawing:** Users can draw and adjust walls dynamically.
- **Floor Material Application:** Users can select and switch between different flooring materials.
- **Furniture Manipulation:** Drag, scale, and rotate furniture elements.
- **Grid-Based Snapping:** Ensures precise placement and alignment.
- **Canvas Navigation:** Supports panning and zooming for better visualization.
- **Undo/Redo Functionality:** Allows users to undo or redo actions, reducing errors.

### üì§ **Export & Sharing**
- **Custom Export:** Users can define export range and dimensions.

### üöÄ **Other Features**
- **SSR/SSG for Speed:** Uses Next.js Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Static Site Generation (SSG) to optimize performance.
- **Authentication:** Supports JWT authentication and OAuth 2.0 (Google login and username/password login).

## Tech Stack
| Technology | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| **TypeScript** | Ensures type safety & maintainability |
| **Next.js** | Enhances performance with SSR/SSG |
| **Redux** | Manages global state efficiently |
| **Fabric.js** | Provides robust 2D canvas manipulation |
